- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   I built a program to read sales from a text file from a whole day, count each item and sort it alphbetically, and give different options to access that data to track and monitor sales. 

- What did you do particularly well?
   I was particularly proud, I think, of getting the program broken up into classes in a clear, logical manner. 

- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
   the Main file could potentially be a touch cleaner. The Python call function might have been able to be pulled into its own class, for instance, or the menu handler could have been pulled out as well. 
   I'm sure there's plenty of ways to make it more efficient or secure, but as far as the scope of this program goes I think I did pretty well. There are a couple of functions
   that potentially could be more condensed with better ways of achieving the same results.

- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
   I think the bit where I printed a histogram gave me som challenges. It was easy, at first, but once I had to think about how to get an item that had more than one word
   in the name, it got trickier. The file for this assignment didn't have any multiword items, so I could have let it slide, but I decided to address the issue now.
   It gave me some great chances to research and really grow confident with building substrings and the like.

- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
   I learned and honed a lot during this project. Object Oriented Programming really started feeling comfortable, and integrating Python began to feel good too.
   If I had to pickone word though for what I learned that would be most helpful, I think it would be abstraction. I think I did well at keeping things hidden in their
   own classes and functions and keeping it all clean and isolated.

- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   Maintainable - I feel like it's pretty well built. The classes make it fairly modular and seperated, so adding, changing, or subtracting should be pretty easy.
   Readable - I did my best to keep it clean and simple. I put in as many comments as I could think to be necessary, and I tried to be as plain speech about it and
              what logic I was using as I could.
   Adaptable - I built it in such a way as to allow change through the future. The menu items, for instance, are populated by a text file, which can be easily updated. 
               Thinking about it, though, it IS limited to 3 menu options and a 4th quit. So, I think I would need to find a way to populate the menu a bit more dynamically,
               as far as the menu logic is concerned. It will print any menu you want though.
